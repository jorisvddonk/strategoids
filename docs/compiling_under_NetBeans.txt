1) Install NetBeans (I've been using 6.7.1, but 6.8 or 6.9beta should work too)
2) Install the NetBeans OpenGL Pack (http://kenai.com/projects/netbeans-opengl-pack/pages/Home)
3) Restart NetBeans (just to make sure)
4) In NetBeans: File -> New Project. Choose a "JOGL Application" project.
   Name it whatever you want, but do *NOT* place it in a folder that's being versioned by the Strategoids SVN repository.
   Hit "finish" and test if you can run the Sample JOGL Application (it should show a triangle and a square).
5) In NetBeans: Right-click on the "Strategoids" project, go to "properties".
   Under "Source Package Folders" on the right, select "src" and hit Remove.
   Hit "Add Folder" and point it to the "trunk\Strategoids\src" folder in the Strategoids SVN repository.
   Hit OK
6) In NetBeans: Right-click on the "Strategoids" project, go to "properties" again.
   Click on "Run" on the left-part 'tree' of the screen that appears.
   Click on the "Browse" button beside "Main Class", and select "strategoids.Strategoids" in the window that appears.
7) Hit run, watch the thing compile and (hopefully) run! :)
8) Celebrate
